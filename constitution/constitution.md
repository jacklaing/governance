# THE POCKET NETWORK CONSTITUTION
This Pocket Network Constitution (this **Constitution**) is a legally binding agreement governing the Pocket DAO. The Pocket DAO governs the Pocket Network and Pocket Blockchain and the use of the Pocket Technologies in connection therewith.

# Mission Statement
The members of the Pocket DAO are united together in the mission to build censorship-resistant technology that will lay the foundation for reorganizing the world’s institutions towards a more equitable, hyper-connected, interplanetary future.

# Principles

1. **Credible Neutrality:** No one User should be favored over any other within their demographic. For example, Protocol Upgrades which favor Nodes over Apps are neutral, but Protocol Upgrades which favor specific App types (e.g. exchanges) or specific Apps (e.g. Binance) are not neutral.
2. **Sustainable Decentralization:** Pocket Network should optimize for as many sovereign Nodes as possible, because this reinforces the resilience and censorship-resistance of the service, but this should not be rushed at the cost of the sustainable growth of Pocket Network.
3. **User-Centrism:** Pocket Network is specialized to provide reliable decentralized infrastructure to Users. We must therefore continue to optimize for 1) User adoption and 2) the qualities that contribute to reliable infrastructure: network redundancy, robust data integrity, data sovereignty, minimal latency, minimal downtime, and minimalist engineering.
4. **Freedom of Movement:** Entry to Pocket Network should be accessible to both Apps and Nodes. Equally, all Pocket Network stakeholders should enjoy the right to exit.
5. **Optionality:** Operating a Node should incur no more costs than the cost of operation. All other responsibilities, e.g. participation in the Council, should be optional.
6. **Agnosticism:** Pocket Network should maintain neutrality as a middleware protocol. While the governance of Pocket Network may be reliant from time to time on other networks or tools, the system itself should retain a level of modularity that facilitates switching out components with minimal friction.
7. **Cross-Chain Diplomacy:** Pocket Network is a middleware protocol, which means our community will come from a wide range of blockchain communities. DAO participants must leave tribalism at the door; they should refrain from engaging in political debates that are not directly relevant to improving the service that Pocket Network provides.
8. **Consensual Collaboration:** While the Pocket Network Council is relatively permissionless, this does not mean anyone is entitled to work. Proposals will be assessed on their merits alone, including Contributors’ fitness to fulfill the proposal. Likewise, Contributors are not required to let any other Contributor work with them, unless the Council has approved a proposal to that effect.

* The Principles are ranked in order of priority.
* Decisions [of???]() must be made according to their furtherance of the Principles. 
* When deciding between alternatives, these alternatives shall be prioritized according to the ordering of the Principles listed above, with higher-ranking Principles to always take priority over lower-ranking Principles. 
* Lower-ranking Principles should only be sacrificed in favor of higher-ranking Principles if a Pareto optimal state has been achieved, i.e. it is not possible to improve one Principle without making another Principle worse off. Until then, the Council shall seek to make only Pareto improvements, where Principles are improved without making any other Principles worse off.
* Once it is no longer possible to optimize any Principle without sacrificing another, this Constitution should be amended to introduce minimum satisfaction thresholds on each Principle.
* Stakeholder rights at any given moment, as defined by the values of On-Chain parameters, may justifiably be sacrificed in the furtherance of the Principles, because it is intended that the Principles, if achieved, will ensure maximum utility to maximum stakeholders.
* The Principles should be designed, in all future iterations of this Constitution, to optimally achieve the mission of the Pocket DAO stated under "Mission Statement" above.

# Covenants

## 1. Pocket DAO Governance

1.1. Governance of the Pocket DAO is an emergent phenomenon arising from the decision-making and activities of a variety of User demographics and other Persons, including:
  * the Pocket Network Foundation;
  * the Pocket Network Council and Council Members;
  * the Pocket Development Company and other developers of Pocket Core and other Pocket Technologies;
* POKT holders; and
* Node operators.

### Legislature / Council

#### Nature & Functions of Council

1.2. The legislative function of the Pocket DAO is performed by the Pocket Network Council, which is the unincorporated nonprofit association of Council Members [NOTE TO DRAFT: DISCUSS "UNINCORPORATED NONPROFIT ASSOCIATION" & JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES](). The Council: (a) monitors, supervises and governs the Foundation, as further set forth in `Section 1` hereof; (b) holds and governs the Council On-Chain Treasury, which is the aggregate of all unspent POKT DAO Funds allocated from POKT Block Rewards; and (c) considers, holds votes with respect to and approves or denies Pocket Improvement Proposals (PIPs), Pocket Ecosystem Proposals (PEPs), and Parameter Update Proposals (PUPs).

#### Council Membership

1.3. A Person shall be deemed a **Council Member** (**Voter**) if and only if: (a) such Person has qualified as a Stakeholder, by reaching the required levels in the POKT Arcade community onboarding game; (b) such Person has validated their Personhood, by using the Council’s chosen anti-sybil mechanism; and (c) such Person has claimed an airdrop of the singular Voting Share (Token) that (a) and (b) entitle them to. 

1.4. Each Council Member shall vote his, her or its Voting Share and otherwise exercise the rights, powers and perquisites of a Council Member on a reasonably informed basis and in good faith, taking into account the Pocket Principles. Each Council Member shall not sell his, her or its Voting Share or any of the other rights, powers and perquisites of being a Council Member or accept any compensation, reward, reimbursement or incentive for voting such Council Member's Voting Share or using such rights, powers and perquisites.

#### Council Proposals

1.5. Proposals to be voted upon by the Council must be submitted solely by Council Members. The immediately preceding sentence shall not be deemed to limit the right, power or discretion of a Council Member to submit such a proposal on behalf of or in cooperation with another User or User demographic, provided that such Council Member independently supports such proposal on its own merits without regard to any personal or business-related affiliation or pecuniary gain with respect to such other User(s) or such proposal and has not breached `Section 4.8`. 

1.6. Proposals are of three main types: Pocket Improvement Proposals (PIPs), Pocket Ecosystem Proposals (PEPs) and Parameter Update Proposals (PUPs), each as defined hereinafter. 

1.7. Proposals will be approved by Majority Approval in votes lasting 7 days or until 50% of Voters have voted yes, unless otherwise specified in this Constitution. 

#### Council Member Representations

Each Person who becomes a Council Member hereby represents and warrants, to and for the benefit of the Council, the Council Members and the Users, as follows, as of the date on which such Person becomes a Council Member and as of each date on which such Person remains a Council Member: 

1.8. Status. If I am an individual, I am of legal age in the jurisdiction in which I reside and a, of sound mind and body. If I am another type of Person (such as a business entity), I am duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which I am organized, and I have all requisite power and authority for a `?` to carry on my business and operations. 

1.9. Power and Authority. I have all requisite capacity, power and authority to accept the terms and conditions of this Constitution and to carry out and perform my obligations under this Constitution. This Constitution constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against me in accordance with its terms. 

1.10. No Conflict; Compliance with Law. My entering into this Constitution and becoming a Council Member does not constitute, and would not reasonably be expected to result in (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) a breach, default, contravention or violation of any Law applicable to me, or any contract or agreement to which I am a party or by which I am bound. 

1.11. Not Subject to Sanctions. I am not, and am not owned or controlled by, or acting on behalf of, any other Person who is, identified on any list of prohibited parties under any Law or by any Governmental Authorities, such as, for example, the lists maintained by the United Nations Security Council, the U.S. government (including the U.S. Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals list and Foreign Sanctions Evaders list), the European Union (EU) or its member states, and the government of my home country. I am not, and am not owned or controlled by, or acting on behalf of, any other Person who is, located, ordinarily resident, organized, established, or domiciled in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, the Crimea region (including Sevastopol) or any other country or jurisdiction against which the U.S. maintains economic sanctions or an arms embargo.

1.12. No Claim, Loan, Ownership Interest or Investment Purpose. I understand and agree that the deposit of any POKT stake in relation to my Council Membership does not: (a) represent or constitute a loan or a contribution of capital to, or other investment in, the Pocket Foundation, the Pocket Development Company or any other Person; (b) provide me with any ownership interest, equity, security, or right to or interest in the assets, rights, properties, revenues or profits of, or voting rights whatsoever in, the foregoing Persons or any other Person; or (c) creates or implies any fiduciary or other agency relationship between me and any of the foregoing Persons or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, equity holders or Affiliates. I am not entering into this Constitution, depositing POKT, or becoming a Council Member for the purpose of making an investment, but solely wish to participate in the Council as a free and voluntary contribution of my time and attention to the Pocket DAO. 

1.13. Non-Reliance. I am knowledgeable, experienced and sophisticated in using and evaluating the Pocket Network, Pocket Technologies and similar networks and technologies. I have conducted my own thorough independent investigation and analysis of the Pocket Network and Pocket Technologies and Pocket DAO in determining to deposit POKT or become a Council Member, and I have not relied upon any information, statement, omission, representation or warranty, express or implied, written or oral, made by or on behalf of the Pocket DAO, the Council, any Council Members or any other person in making such decision or any other decision relating to the Pocket DAO or the other matters contemplated by this Constitution.

#### PIPs

**Pocket Improvement Proposals (PIPs)** are proposals to improve Pocket Core or the other Pocket Technologies or the Pocket Network or Pocket Blockchain or Council governance procedures. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, PIPs include Protocol Upgrades and Governance Upgrades. 

1.14. PIPs should not contain multiple new specifications that could feasibly be divided into separate proposals without losing their meaning. This policy is intended to prevent omnibus proposals whereby unpopular proposals are pushed through by bundling them with popular proposals. 

1.15. The execution of successful consensus-breaking Protocol Upgrades should be delayed by a period equal to the Unbonding Period plus one day, to give Bonded Users time to unbond and exit the network before the upgrade is executed.

#### PEPs

**Pocket Ecosystem Proposals (PEPs)** are proposals to provide funding out of the Council On-Chain Treasury to or form agreements with other Pocket DAO participants. 

1.16. Because the Pocket DAO is a non-profit multi-stakeholder organization, the Council shall only approve PEPs in the form of grants.

#### PUPs

**Parameter Update Proposals (PUPs)** are proposals to change the value of a given parameter of the Pocket Blockchain, including proposals to change: (a) the monetary policy of the Pocket Blockchain (i.e., economic parameters such as BaseRelaysPerPOKT and StabilityAdjustment); (b) the whitelist of blockchain networks supported by the Pocket Blockchain (i.e., the SupportedBlockchains parameter); and (c) the consensus mechanisms of the Pocket Blockchain (i.e., consensus parameters such as UnstakingTime, MaximumChains and FraudulentRelayBatchPenalty). A full list of parameters is maintained at: [https://forum.pokt.network/t/list-of-governable-parameters/370][3]

1.17. The following parameters will be governed by the Foundation in order to fulfill the target values for USDRelayTargetRange and ReturnOnInvestmentTarget set by the Council: BaseRelaysPerPOKT & StabilityAdjustment. The Foundation will anchor around the Council’s target according to a 14-day average; if the actual relay price exceeds this target range temporarily, the Foundation can ignore it, but if the range is exceeded on average for 14 days, the Foundation must respond.

### Executive / Foundation

#### Nature & Functions of Foundation

1.18. The executive function of the Pocket DAO is performed by the Pocket Network Foundation, which is a Cayman Islands foundation company limited by guarantee. The Foundation is governed by its Articles of Association, a copy of which is available at https://github.com/pokt-network/governance/blob/master/foundation/Pocket-Network-Foundation-Articles-of-Association-Highlighted.pdf (the **Foundation Articles**). Without limiting the generality of the immediately following Article `1.19`, the Foundation's objectives include:
* serving as a fiduciary agent of the Council
* stewarding the Pocket Technologies and Pocket Network, including Pocket Core
* requesting funds from the Council for specific projects that have strategic value to the Pocket Technologies or Pocket DAO, by submitting PEPs.

#### Foundation Articles; Responsibility to Council

1.19. The following is only a summary of certain provisions of the Articles and is subordinated in its entirety to the full text of the Articles; in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Constitution and the Articles, the actual text of the Articles shall prevail:
* The Articles refer to the Council as the "DAO" and require the Council's approval of substantially all actions of the Foundation, including the appointment and removal of Foundation directors and supervisor
* The Articles require the Foundation directors not to hold any administrative or other position in the Council (other than the position of general Council Member by virtue of being a Council Member) and to observe, implement, carry out and execute with best efforts any and all resolutions of the Council, except as otherwise required by their fiduciary duties and applicable law.
* The Articles require the Foundation directors to provide the Council with notices and other information concerning the Foundation's business and affairs, the appointment/remove of alternate directors or secretaries, any resignations of directors or supervisors, the directors' discharge of their duties and exercise of their powers and such other information as may be required by the Council.

#### Signaling Era; Future Governance Designs

1.20. Proposed actions that are approved per `1.7` will not automatically execute. Their method of execution will depend on the domain in which they execute:
* Off-Chain: the Pocket Foundation will execute decisions as the Council’s fiduciary agent
* Non-Pocket Blockchain: a Council Member must stake collateral to submit the decision as a Governance Transaction on a Non-Pocket Blockchain (e.g. Ethereum)
* Pocket Blockchain: the ACL permission holder must submit the decision as a Governance Transaction on the Pocket Blockchain

1.21. The Foundation multi-sig will hold all ACL permissions at launch, for the purpose of executing Pocket Blockchain Governance Transactions per `1.20`, but the Council may work to automate (and thus disintermediate) the Executive function by building a cross-chain integration between the Pocket Blockchain and the Smart Contract that enables Council Members to stake collateral on Non-Pocket Blockchain Governance Transactions. The period before automatic cross-chain execution is achieved will be referred to as the Signaling Era. During the Signaling Era, the Council may utilize Smart Contracts as a convenient method for holding votes, granting Voting Tokens, and executing resolutions in Non-Pocket Blockchains, but the execution of resolutions in the Pocket Blockchain remain subject to the good faith interpretation and discretion of the ACL and thus the Foundation. At the end of the Signaling Era, the Foundation shall pass a resolution pursuant to Section 1.6(a) of the Foundation Articles determining that the Council is autonomous and able to execute any and all resolutions.

#### Transaction Batching

1.22. By default, the Foundation will batch Pocket Blockchain Governance Transactions on a weekly basis, unless an alternative schedule is specified in this Constitution.

### Judiciary / Aragon Court & Nodes

1.23. The judiciary functions of the Pocket Council are performed by Aragon Court. 

1.24. Any Council Member may challenge actions, if they think the action violates this Constitution. The outcome of disputes under this Judiciary function will be determined per `3. Arbitration`.

1.25. As the parties responsible for validating Pocket Blockchain Governance Transactions, including amendments to the Pocket Protocol itself, which takes precedence over this Constitution per `1.3`, Nodes are the ultimate arbiters on all Pocket Network matters.

###  Diplomatic & Regulatory / Nodes

1.26. The diplomatic and regulatory functions of the Pocket DAO are performed by the Nodes. Nodes receive, transmit and propagate transactions and data through the Pocket Network, between the Pocket Network and other blockchain networks, and between applications and the Pocket Network and other blockchain networks. Validator Nodes enforce the Pocket Protocol and ensure the Pocket Blockchain conforms to its rules by proposing blocks and validating the blocks proposed by other Validator Nodes. 

1.27. Each Node, solely by connecting to the Pocket Network, shall be deemed to consent in all respects to the Pocket Protocol, the results of operations of which shall be final and binding upon each Node. Without limiting the foregoing, each Validator Node shall be deemed to consent in all respects to the slashing of such Validator Node's staked POKT in accordance with the Pocket Protocol and hereby waives, relinquishes and releases any and all claim against any Person arising from the loss of staked POKT in accordance with the Pocket Protocol.

### Citizenry / Users

1.28. The citizenry of the Pocket DAO are End-Users in their capacities as such. End-Users utilize, rely upon and enjoy the benefits of the Pocket Network, and pay transaction fees and taxes (dilution through Block Rewards and burning of stakes proportional to relays submitted) where applicable. End-Users may be POKT holders, Persons who submit transactions to POKT Nodes for transmission to other blockchain networks or applications that rely on the Pocket Network or its Nodes. [NOTE: consider just making it Users. I think the only delta is that Users would include persons who run Nodes, which seems okay]().

## 2. Liability

2.1. The Foundation is a distinct legal entity representing the Pocket DAO in various matters, under supervision of the Council. This means the Pocket DAO accepts no liability and all disputes, including claims of tort, must be directed to the Foundation. 

2.2. Users shall be liable for losses caused by false or misleading attestations, such as fraudulent relay proofs, and shall forfeit any stake thereby according to the consensus rules of the Pocket Protocol. 

2.3. Software developers (such as the Pocket Development Company) are contracted by the Foundation on behalf of the Pocket DAO to develop Pocket Core. Because the Foundation defers to the Council, the Council is ultimately responsible for reviewing new software and approving Protocol Upgrades. Further, the Validator Nodes are responsible for accepting Pocket Blockchain Governance Transactions approved by the Council, and Users consent to the Validator Nodes' decisions through their use of the blockchain in accordance with `Article 7.1`. Therefore, the Users agree to hold software developers harmless for unintentional mistakes made in the expression of contractual intent, whether or not said mistakes were due to actual or perceived negligence.

## 3. Finances

3.1. Contributors agree to pay taxes on all Pocket DAO-related income in whichever jurisdiction they reside. The Pocket DAO will not be held liable for any neglect in this matter.

3.2. The Pocket DAO will only accept incoming payments to its treasury in the form of the POKT Block Reward. For outgoing payments to recipients who may have not consented to this Constitution, the Pocket DAO will send funds piecemeal from the Council On-Chain Treasury to the Foundation's On-Chain multi-signature wallet for specific PEPs.

3.3. It is forbidden to propose or approve unconditional general distributions of the Council On-Chain Treasury to token holders, which may be misconstrued as dividends.

3.4. The Foundation may on the Council's behalf exchange POKT for another cryptocurrency or token for the purpose of using external blockchains.

## 4. Amendments

### Constitutional Amendments

4.1. This Constitution may be amended according to Majority Approval in the PIP process, unless otherwise specified in ‘Immutability’ and ‘Undo’ below.

#### Immutability

4.2. No Constitution amended to modify clauses or definitions marked with a ‡ will be accepted under any circumstance except per 8.6. 

4.3. Constitutions amended to introduce a ‡ will be accepted if they have first received Supermajority Approval in the PIP process.

4.4. No Constitution amended to modify clauses or definitions marked with a †, or to introduce a †, will be accepted unless the proposed amendment has first received Supermajority Approval in the PIP process.

#### Undo

4.5. At any time, a supermajority vote may reverse the latest constitutional amendment (but no amendment that has been superseded by a new version). This "undo" mechanism shall prevail over the immutability mechanisms.

#### Executing Constitutional Amendments

4.6. All relevant permission holders must act to execute new versions of the Constitution by updating Pocket Core and/or relevant off-chain tools, platforms, or mechanisms, within 7 days, or else they will be removed from the permissions they hold.

#### Crediting Constitutional Amendments

4.7. Authors of constitutional amendments will be listed chronologically as authors of the Constitution.

#### Tracking Constitutional Amendments

4.8. Amendments which modify existing clauses will add a 0.01 increment to the Constitution version for every modification. Amendments which introduce/remove clauses will add a 0.1 increment to the Constitution version for every modification.

#### Upgrading the Council

4.9. Where the Pocket DAO is unable to directly own the root permissions in an off-chain tool or platform it uses, the Foundation will hold the root permissions and will therefore be responsible for any Council upgrades that have been approved in the PIP process.

4.10. If an upgrade involves introducing a new platform, which may use different addresses, the Foundation will be responsible for configuring the new platform.

### Pocket Core Amendments

4.11. Consensus-breaking Protocol Upgrades (including changes to the ACL) will be approved by the Council according to the PIP process.

4.12. Upgrades are pushed to Nodes in a dormant state then, once the Council has signaled approval, the Foundation will activate the upgrade retroactively by submitting a Governance Transaction.

4.13. Pocket Core's upgrade process is permissive. Node operators can keep pocket-runner on their Pocket Core installation if they consent to automatically updating their Nodes according to the Council's decisions. If they decide they want to refuse the Council's decisions, they can replace pocket-runner with their own versioning software and ignore Governance Transactions. This power is subject to a Tendermint consensus test, whereby 66%+ of the nodes must refuse the Council's decision in order for the blockchain to continue to operate normally without forking.

### Foundation Amendments

4.14. Because Supervisor decisions are not valid unless ratified by the Council, no upgrade can be made to the Foundation's Articles without the Council first signaling approval.

## 5. Initialization

5.1. No decision by the Council shall be legitimate until the founding Voters of the Council have unanimously approved this Constitution.

5.2. The App and Node Unbonding Periods will be changed from 21 days to 1 hour once Decentralization Day has been achieved, subject to Majority Approval.

# Interpretation, Dispute Resolution, Etc.

## 6. Interpretation

6.1. The Mission Statement and Principles are non-binding recitals provided for informational purposes only; provided, however, that in the event of any ambiguity in the interpretation of the plain language of the Articles, the resolution of such ambiguity shall take into account the Mission Statement and Principles. 

6.2. Any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be applied in the construction or interpretation of this Constitution.

6.3. This Constitution does not take precedence over the Pocket Protocol. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between this Constitution and the Pocket Protocol, the Pocket Protocol shall prevail.

## 7. Binding Nature of Constitution

7.1. Each Person who directly or indirectly uses, operates, executes, installs, sends transactions to or receives transactions from or accesses: (a) the Pocket Network (whether through Pocket Core or any other software); (b) the Pocket Blockchain; or (c) any of the other Pocket Technologies in connection with the Pocket Network or Pocket Blockchain (each such Person, a *User*) is, without any further any action or agreement, automatically deemed to have consented to and agreed to be bound by and become a party to this Constitution.

7.2. Without limiting the generality of Section 2.1, entry into the Council shall constitute consent to the terms of this Constitution. 

7.3. All service providers who stake or sign transactions on behalf of Users, or develop tools to facilitate staking or signing by Users, shall make every effort to inform said Users of this Constitution's terms. Service providers shall be liable for losses resulting from failure to do this.

7.4. In the event that the Council moves to amend this Constitution or the Pocket Protocol, consent may be revoked through exiting or forking, but will be immediately reinstated upon continued use of the blockchain, unless such use is required to facilitate exiting or forking.

## 8. Entire Agreement

8.1. This Constitution constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties (or any of them) with respect to the subject matter hereof.

## 9. Severability

9.1. In the event any one or more of the provisions of this Constitution is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part or in any respect, or in the event that any one or more of the provisions of this Constitution operate or would prospectively operate to invalidate this Constitution, then and in any such event, such provisions only will be deemed null and void and will not affect any other provision of this Constitution and the remaining provisions of this Constitution will remain operative and in full force and effect and will not be affected, prejudiced, or disturbed thereby.

## 10. Notices

10.1. Any notice required or permitted by this Constitution will be deemed sufficient when published on the Pocket Blockchain or through other electronic means reasonably sufficient to notify each and all of the Parties hereto concurrently.

## 11. Arbitration

11.1. Unless otherwise stated in this Constitution, any controversy between members of the Council (Voters) arising out of or in connection with this Constitution shall be submitted to Aragon Court for resolution under its public arbitration rules, as amended from time to time.

11.2. Controversies under `11.1` and relating to On-Chain Governance Transactions must be submitted before the transaction executes On-Chain; if not, the transaction is irreversible and the controversy shall be deemed resolved in favor of the transaction.

11.3. In the event that Aragon Court is not accessible, or transactions cannot be directly submitted On-Chain by Voters (e.g. in the case of Pocket Blockchain Governance Transactions per `1.20`, the Pocket Network Foundation will interpret and rule on any disputes that are raised by any Voter. If the Foundation’s ruling does not satisfy a Voter, they may formally request that the Foundation refer the dispute to the International Chamber of Commerce for arbitration according to their rules.

11.4. By consenting to this Constitution, all Parties waive their right to resolve any controversy in any manner other than defined in this Constitution. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS CONSTITUTION, the Pocket DAO, OR THE MATTERS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF SUCH PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

[NOTE TO SELF: CHOICE OF LAW?]() [NOTE TO SELF: BEEF UP ARBITRATION PROVISIONS ('final, binding and determinative resolution' etc.)]() ###LIABILITY LIMITATIONS No Personal Liability. Except as otherwise provided by applicable Legal Requirement or expressly in Constitution, no Council Member or other participant in the Pocket DAO will be obligated personally for any debt, obligation, or other Liability of the Pocket DAO or the Council, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, solely by reason of being a Council Member, participant in the Pocket DAO or User. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the foregoing limitations shall not apply with respect to any fraud or a knowing and intentional violation of this Constitution or any applicable Legal Requirement by a Council Member. No Right of Partition. No Council Member, Pocket DAO Participant or other User shall have the right to seek or obtain partition by court decree or operation of law of, or the right to personally own or use, any of the Council On-Chain Treasury or funds of the Pocket Foundation. Liabilities and Duties of Council Members and other Pocket DAO Participants. This Constitution is not intended to, and does not, create or impose any fiduciary or (except for the contractual duty to perform the express provisions of this Constitution, including the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing) other duty on any Council Member or other Pocket DAO participant or User. Furthermore, except to the extent prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements, the Council, the Pocket DAO and each of the Council Members hereby waives and agrees to the elimination of any and all such duties that, absent such waiver, may be implied by any applicable Legal Requirement or otherwise, and in doing so, acknowledges and agrees that the duties and obligations of each Council Member, Pocket DAO participant and User are only as expressly set forth in this Constitution. The provisions of this Constitution, to the extent that they restrict the duties and Liabilities of a Council Member otherwise existing at law or in equity or otherwise under applicable Legal Requirements, are agreed by all Pocket DAO participants to replace such duties. Whenever in this Constitution a Council Member or other Pocket DAO participant or other Person (including the Pocket Foundation) is permitted or required to make a decision, such Person shall be entitled to consider only such interests and factors as such Person desires, including its own interests, and shall have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or other factors, except that such Person shall take the Principles into account in good faith.
